# Analysis of Faux Amis (False Cognates) translation quality in English-French Machine Translation

Using mainly R and some Python I analyzed the quality of Faux Amis translation between English and French. 
The goal of the research project was to determine the best model for translating texts containing false cognates. 

I chose MBart, NLLB and ALIGN models as candidates for comparison as they are all multilingual and offer high quality translation to and from each language of interest. 
Aside from data mining and dataset creation, I used a variety of statistical analysis techniques to choose the best performing model - ALIGN.
